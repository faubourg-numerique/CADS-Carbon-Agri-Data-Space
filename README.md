# CADS - Carbon Agri Data Space
A data space for the assessment of the carbon footprint of agricultural products and tools for sound agrotechnological and management decisions.
### An i4Trust experiment
The creation of the Carbon Agri Data Space (CADS) is realised by an international consortium of SMEs through an experiment supported be the European Project [i4Trust](https://i4trust.org): See the description of the experiment on the i4Trust website: https://i4trust.org/experiments/cads/

## CADS principles
In order to initiate the Carbon Agri Data Space, in addition to the i4Trust mentorship, the stakeholders follow the approach supported by the [Data Spaces Support Centre](https://dssc.eu/) (DSSC) described in the [DSSC Starter Kit](https://dssc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSSC-Starterkit-Version-1.0.pdf) and try to adopt the vocabulary referenced on the [DSSC Glossary](https://dssc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DSSC-Data-Spaces-Glossary-v1.0.pdf).

## Business value and models
#### How does the data space create value?
#### Who creates value, and For whom is value created?
#### What is the data space's business and governance mode?
#### What are the individual and collaborative business models (Incentives) for the actors in the data space?
#### What is the data and organizational governance model?

## Legal and Governance
#### What legal aspects are relevant to navigate when setting up a data space?
#### How can data spaces ensure the full uptake of EU values?

## Operational
#### What is the operational governance framework for the data space?
#### Who are the active stakeholders or participants of the data space?
#### How will you assure and gain trust from data holders and users?

## Functionality
#### What are the essential technical services you need to implement in your data space?
#### Are there existing dependencies?
#### What are the data standards you will use to ensure interoperability between partners in your data space and in other data spaces?

## Technology
#### What technology stacks (e.g., open source implementations, standard specifications) will you use to create or join a data space?
